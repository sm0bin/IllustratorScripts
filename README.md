# IllustratorScripts

IllustratorScripts is a collection of useful Adobe Illustrator scripts to streamline your workflow and make your design tasks more efficient. This is incredibly handy for creating background shapes that span the entire canvas.

## Background Layer and Design Layer

- **Background Layer:** This script takes your existing layer and converts it into a background layer. This is helpful when you want to keep certain elements as a constant backdrop for your design.

- **Design Layer:** After converting the existing layer to the background layer, a new layer named "design" is created. You can use this layer to work on your design elements without interfering with the background.

## Artboard-sized Rectangles

- **ArtboardBackgroundAll:** This script creates artboard-sized rectangles on all artboards in the background layer.
- **ArtboardBackgroundSelected:** This script creates artboard-sized rectangles on the selected artboard in the background layer.
